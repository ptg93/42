# push_swap_guilletester

Welcome to push_swap_guilletester. A tester made with love by gumoreno, me :) to help improve your 42 project “push_swap” :)

Clone the repo into your push_swap folder (at the same level of your Makefile) and enter it. 

There you will find three executable files:

	./push_swap_tester.sh   --> Run your push_swap on multiple ramdom combinations of numbers and test its limits and if it sorts correctly. 
        
	./push_swap_parser.sh   --> Test if push_swap is handling input arguments correctly (based on how "checher_linux" handles it).

	./push_swap_eval.sh     --> A battery of different tests will be run on your push_swap project.

You can find several flags to be used in each of the executable files. Check it with the --help flag.

(push_swap_guilletester will run on both Linux and Mac)
       
Enjoy it! :)
